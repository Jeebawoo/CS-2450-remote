Date: 8.25.25 - First day of full week
-In software dev we assigned groups and went over the basic uses of git.
-In C++ we did an introduction to the language and demonstrated some of 
the features of the language such as the stream operator and the use of 
std::cout and std::cin. 
-For Programming Languages we touched on the topics of surface and 
abstract syntax, evaluation, and the importance of evaluation choices 
at certain points in the evaluation process. 

10-3-25: inspired ideas from game dev videos about designing game
chains rather than exclusively loops and about making polished modular
systems that can be easily incoprorated into games in a compositional
fashion.

Making partially evaluated functions that encompass the entire range
of a system and how certian parameters or kinds of parameters impact
the system as a whole without needing to make many functions or remake
one over and over

A good application of this could be in terrain generation (especially
procedurally generated terrain and landscapes)
